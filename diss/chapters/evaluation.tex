\section{Statistical tests}
To evaluate the correctness of my PPL, I used statistical tests which measure goodness-of-fit, i.e. how similar two distributions are to each other. I compare the empirical distribution of 10,000 samples from an approximated distribution to an exact distribution which is calculated analytically. 

For all tests described below, I set the null and alternative hypotheses as follows:

$H_0:$ The sample data follow the exact distribution
$H_1:$ The sample data do not follow the exact distribution

Setting the significance level, $\alpha = 0.01$ for all tests
