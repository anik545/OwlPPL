talk up myppl with wrt to performance more.

work out why its better

find out why its better/worse

talk more about memory footprint

both clojure and node are garbage collected but im still better for each
point out there are error bars that can barely be seen

comment in conclusion that memory is very low.
memory footprint makes it appropriate for edge computing

check memory footprint for large particles/memory.

writing should make clear an argument

single concept per paragraph - intro, context/expansion, example
think about argument to make

capitalisation in section headings
related works -> work
consistency (e.g tense)

preparation -
requirements + starting point?
tools -> ocaml + owl (same level)

bayesian inference under ppl

2.8+2.7+2.9 -

whole section on probabilistic programming
 -> two approaches
 -> im using trace driven, therefore these equations for inference
 -> explain why these inference algorithms

lead reader down path, explain why this path

signposting in sections

first/last para of each chapter. 

proffesional practice -> end

put repo overview into proff. practice

3.2 -> give examples of combining primitives - talk more about language design - why is it a dsl
    -> what are the components of the dsl - what is the dsl, can i specify the dsl (sample/observe)

inference alg in prep -> 

change section heading in 3.6 to implenting inferencing
clearly mention which class each algorithm belongs to

profesional practice testing -> make clear got unit tests 
in prep, say i will talk in more detail about the challenges of testing (forward reference)
In the implementation testing section, give concrete example of a unit test that wont work. How to deal wiht this failure? (use fixed seed) - doesnt always work. (find some good reference papers)

evaluation -> subsectioin for each example -> with the problem

graphical representation of each model with code
sprinkler model as a 

put code coverage stuff in an appendix

some of the code listing could be wrapped

consider doing a \paragraph instead to just do a bold word instead of a section heading

chapter 1 get rid of section heading 

say more in related works (maybe table of different ppl)

could get 4 plots into a single line

personal reflection in conclusion

dont talk about things as if they were easy

talk about some real world applications 
-> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/toplas08.pdf pg1 has references

talk about the name, owlppl

add a pie chart of gprof output
add a line chart of memory usage over time from spacetime.
