talk up myppl with wrt to performance more.

work out why its better

find out why its better/worse

talk more about memory footprint

both clojure and node are garbage collected but im still better for each

comment in conclusion that memory is very low.
memory footprint makes it appropriate for edge computing

check memory footprint for large particles/memory.

writing should make clear an argument

single concept per paragraph - intro, context/expansion, example
think about argument to make

capitalisation in section headings
related works -> work
consistency (e.g tense)

preparation -
requirements + starting point?
tools -> ocaml + owl (same level)


lead reader down path, explain why this path


inference alg in prep -> 

change section heading in 3.6 to implenting inferencing
clearly mention which class each algorithm belongs to

talk about some real world applications 
-> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/toplas08.pdf pg1 has references

talk about the name, owlppl
