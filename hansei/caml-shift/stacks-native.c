	   Native-code implementation of the scAPI:
        noting stack pointers and copying C stacks fragments

  This code deals with exception frames and stack fragments
  between two exception frames in NATIVE-code OCaml.

  The code is written for the x86 and amd64 architecture. 

  This file implements two abstract data types: |ek| for exception frame
  pointers, and |ekfragment| for the stack fragment between two exception
  frames. These data types are used in delimcc.ml

  In Native OCaml, stacks grow downwards or upwards, depending on
  the architecture. At present, we do not support systems where the
  stack grows upwards (to the larger addresses): such systems seem
  too rare to bother with.
  Trap (exception) frames are linked, the global caml_exception_pointer 
  (if not NULL) points to the top trap frame.

 Justification for stack copying:

 The examination of asmcomp/i386/emit.mlp shows that the absolute stack 
 address is only manipulated in the pieces of the code related to
 exception handling: in Lpushtrap, Lpoptrap, and Lraise Cmm instructions.
 The absolute stack address is also used in the standard C frame linking,
 the sequence "pushl %ebp; movl %esp,%ebp". That sequence appears
 in OCaml-generated code only when the profiler is invoked; %ebp is 
 restored afterwards. We do not capture continuations from
 within the profiler.
 OCaml does not use C-style stack frames and C-style linking. With
 two exceptions, OCaml's native program stack does not contain absolute 
 stack pointers. Therefore, the stack or its parts may be copied.
 The two exceptions are:
  -- When OCaml calls C and the C code calls OCaml, the stack
     contains C code frames, which follow C-style linking.
     As usual, we should not capture continuations from a call-back
     that extends past the point the call-back has been invoked.
     Capturing C-code frames in continuations is always the invitation
     for trouble. Scheme systems have exactly the same limitation;
     call-backs from C code may not use call/cc, ever.
     Delimited continuations have an edge here: we can safely use
     continuations in a call-back provided that their scope is within
     the call-back.
     The file asmrun/fail.c shows another reason why capturing
     C stack frames is dangerous: we may overlook caml-local-roots,
     which are global roots to OCaml values that are registered
     by the C code, by FFI CAMLlocal macros.

  -- trap frames links. We have to adjust these links when copying
     the stack. We had to do the adjustment in the byte code too.

Exceptions are really stable points: proc.ml (on i386, amd64 and
ia64 architectures) says that all phys registers are destroyed by
'raise.' The exception handler would not assume that the register contain
anything useful: the register caches are `flushed', so to speak.

When a C function (such as the C functions in this file) is entered,
globals caml_last_return_address and caml_bottom_of_stack (lowest
stack address) are set.
The global caml_last_return_address is the address to return to the
ML code that invoked the C function.
The global caml_bottom_of_stack points to the last word of the last
ML stack frame. Typically -- certainly on i386 and amd64 --
caml_bottom_of_stack points to the first word of the stack before 
the return pointer to the ML code. That is, typically 
  caml_last_return_address == *((word*)caml_bottom_of_stack - 1)

On some architectures (e.g., amd64) the value of the
caml_exception_pointer is kept in a dedicated register while ML code
is running. The register is stored in the global
caml_exception_pointer only when a C function is called.  When the C
function returns, the register is typically NOT reloaded from the
global caml_exception_pointer. Therefore, changing the global within a
C function would have no effect on the operation of the ML code on
some architectures. The sole exception is raising an exception in the
C code. In that case, the current value of caml_exception_pointer is
loaded into its dedicated register and the exception handling is
initiated. Therefore, to stay portable, any C function that wishes to
modify caml_exception_pointer must exit abnormally, by
raising an exception.


The biggest challenge of capturing a portion of the native code stack
is that the native stack -- unlike the stack of the byte-code
interpreter -- contains unboxed values. We can't make the captured
portion of the stack an OCaml heap value.  We can't let GC scan the
captured stack as a regular heap value.  We have to know which words
on the stack are definitely the ML heap pointers. The compiler
provides this information for us in the form of frame tables.

See asmrun/stack.h for the format of the frame table and
asmrun/roots.c for the algorithm to scan the stack.

XXX refuse to operate when local_roots are non-zero?

Attempting to quantify costs:
`W5Direct.test5 ()' in bench_nondet runs at 27.82 sec.
Disabling stat_free (that is, letting the garbage accumulate), the
running time of the benchmark becomes 27.5 sec
Using the dummy allocator (and 200 MB of initial memory),
the running time becomes  27.4 sec.
  Conclusion: malloc/free are not the bottleneck.
If I remove 
  const frame_descr * fd1 = find_frame((char *)tp1);
  (which is needed only for checking)
the time is 27.6 sec.
Conclusion: find_frame is not the bottleneck.

Compiling -O2 and simplifying pop_stack_fragment:
the running time is 25.1 sec.

Simplifying API, transitioning to copy_stack_fragment:
the running time is 22.4 sec.

NB!! Although this code can be compiled with -O2 by GCC 4.2.1, 4.5 and
4.6, GCC 4.7 over-optimizes the code. To use GCC 4.7, one should either
disable optimizations, or do
	-O2 -fno-ipa-sra
Thanks to Anthony Tavener for investigation.
However,

Ivan Gotovchits on Jun  5, 2017 pointed out the use of attribute to disable the
optimizations.
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas.html#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes

So, the present code uses appropriate attributes that prevent the inlining
and movements of the critical function, as explained below. So, the
present code is safe to compile with optimizations on.

  Push the captured stack fragment back onto the stack

  Since OCaml calls the most recent ML stack frame as caml_bottom_of_stack,
  the captured stack fragment is pushed to the `bottom of the stack' in
  OCaml terminology. Contrary to its common meaning, push and pop in
  OCaml affect the `bottom' of the stack rather than its `top'.

  This is quite tricky as we are going to manipulate the stack
  we ourselves are using. Also, we should keep GC happy, that is,
  maintain the linkage of ML stack frames as described by the frametables.

  On entrance to this function, the stack has the following layout:

            |.................... |
	    |       C frame       |
	    -----------------------
            | last_return_address |  =  caml_last_return_address
	    -----------------------
	    |        ML frame     |  <- caml_bottom_of_stack
	    |.....................|
	    |      trap frame     |  <- caml_exception_pointer


  The captured fragment has the following layout
            |  trap frame bottom  |
	    | ................... |
	    -----------------------
	    | captured_last_addr  |

  First we reserve enough stack space, via alloca. Second, we invoke
  an auxiliary function push_stack_fragment_really. So, the stack has
  this layout

	    | push_really C frame |
	    -----------------------
            |       reserved      |
            |.................... |
	    |  push_stack C frame |
	    -----------------------
            | last_return_address |
	    -----------------------
	    |        ML frame     |  <- caml_bottom_of_stack
	    |.....................|
	    |      trap frame     |  <- caml_exception_pointer

  The function push_stack_fragment_really now copies the captured
  fragment (except the last word of it, captured_last_addr) onto
  the reserved space, *overwriting* the push_stack C frame. So,
  the stack will look as follows


	    | push_really C frame |
	    -----------------------
            |  optional filler    |
            |  ................   |
            |  trap frame bottom  |  <- caml_exception_pointer, bottom_of_stack
	    | ................... |
	    -----------------------
            | new_return_address  |
	    -----------------------
	    |      trap frame     |

  captured_last_addr is of no use: first of all, it pertains to the frame
  from which the captured fragment was split off. (In OCaml, the return
  address is the first word of the next frame rather than the last
  word of the current one.) Second, the captured stack fragment contains
  raise at the end, so it never normally returns. So, we overwrite
  captured_return_address with new_return_address, which is determined
  from the frame table associated with 'trap frame'. 

  The final arrangement makes the captured fragment to appear to
  immediately follow the ML trap frame, as desired -- reversing
  the situation that existed at capture. Now, the function
  push_stack_fragment_really, having overwritten the stack frame of
  its parent, can't return normally. So, it raises the delimcc_exc
  exception. The execution will continue from trap frame pointed to
  the caml_exception_pointer, which is the first frame of the pushed
  stack fragment.

  Alas, in native code, we can't check for stack overflow and
  resize the stack.

  The push_stack_fragment functions do NO ML heap allocations!
