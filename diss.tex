\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview of the files}

This document consists of the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Makefile} --- The Makefile for the dissertation and Project Proposal
\item {\tt diss.tex} --- The dissertation
\item {\tt propbody.tex} --- Appendix~C  -- the project proposal 
\item {\tt proposal.tex}  --- A \LaTeX\ main file for the proposal 
\item{\tt figs} -- A directory containing diagrams and pictures
\item{\tt refs.bib} --- The bibliography database
\end{itemize}

\section{Building the document}

This document was produced using \LaTeXe which is based upon
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport86}.  To build the document you first need to
generate {\tt diss.aux} which, amongst other things, contains the
references used.  This if done by executing the command:

{\tt latex diss}

\noindent
Then the bibliography can be generated from {\tt refs.bib} using:

{\tt bibtex diss}

\noindent
Finally, to ensure all the page numbering is correct run {\tt latex}
on {\tt diss.tex} until the {\tt .aux} files do not change.  This
usually takes 2 more runs.

\subsection{The makefile}

To simplify the calls to {\tt latex} and {\tt bibtex}, 
a makefile has been provided, see Appendix~\ref{makefile}. 
It provides the following facilities:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\tt make} \\
 Display help information.

\item{\tt make prop} \\
 Run {\tt latex proposal; xdvi proposal.dvi}.

\item{\tt make diss.ps} \\
 Make the file {\tt diss.ps}.

\item{\tt make gv} \\
 View the dissertation using ghostview after performing 
{\tt make diss.ps}, if necessary.

\item{\tt make gs} \\
 View the dissertation using ghostscript after performing 
{\tt make diss.ps}, if necessary.

\item{\tt make count} \\
Display an estimate of the word count.

\item{\tt make all} \\
Construct {\tt proposal.dvi} and {\tt diss.ps}.

\item{\tt make pub} \\ Make a {\tt .tar} version of the {\tt demodiss}
directory and place it in my {\tt public\_html} directory.

\item{\tt make clean} \\ Delete all files except the source files of
the dissertation. All these deleted files can be reconstructed by
typing {\tt make all}.

\item{\tt make pr} \\
Print the dissertation on your default printer.

\end{itemize}


\section{Counting words}

An approximate word count of the body of the dissertation may be
obtained using:

{\tt wc diss.tex}

\noindent
Alternatively, try something like:

\verb/detex diss.tex | tr -cd '0-9A-Z a-z\n' | wc -w/

\section{Verbatim text}

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }
  RESULTIS 0
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Tables}

\begin{samepage}
Here is a simple example\footnote{A footnote} of a table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
Left      & Centred & Right \\
Justified &         & Justified \\[3mm]
%\hline\\%[-2mm]
First     & A       & XXX \\
Second    & AA      & XX  \\
Last      & AAA     & X   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
There is another example table in the proforma.
\end{samepage}

\section{Simple diagrams}

Simple diagrams can be written directly in \LaTeX.  For example, see
figure~\ref{latexpic1} on page~\pageref{latexpic1} and see
figure~\ref{latexpic2} on page~\pageref{latexpic2}.

\begin{figure}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\begin{center}

\put(0,60){\framebox(50,10){BBB}}
\put(0,40){\framebox(50,10){CCC}}
\put(0,20){\framebox(50,10){DDD}}
\put(0,00){\framebox(50,10){EEE}}

\put(75,80){\framebox(50,10){XXX}}

\put(100,50){\vector(0,1){10}}

\put(50,65){\vector(1,0){25}}
\put(75,65){\vector(-1,0){25}}
\end{picture}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{latexpic1}A picture composed of boxes and vectors.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\put(57,12){\line(0,2){6}}
\end{picture}

\end{center}
\caption{\label{latexpic2}A diagram composed of circles, lines and boxes.}
\end{figure}



\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript to represent complicated graphics.
Figure~\ref{epsfig} and ~\ref{xfig} on page \pageref{xfig} are
examples. The second figure was drawn using {\tt xfig} and exported in
{\tt.eps} format. This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centerline{\epsfbox{figs/cuarms.eps}}
\caption{\label{epsfig}Example figure using encapsulated postscript}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\vspace{4in}
\caption{\label{pastedfig}Example figure where a picture can be pasted in}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[tbh]

\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Printing and binding}

If you have access to a laser printer that can print on two sides, you
can use it to print two copies of your dissertation and then get them
bound by the Computer Laboratory Bookshop. Otherwise, print your
dissertation single sided and get the Bookshop to copy and bind it double
sided.


Better printing quality can sometimes be obtained by giving the
Bookshop an MSDOS 1.44~Mbyte 3.5" floppy disc containing the
Postscript form of your dissertation. If the file is too large a
compressed version with {\tt zip} but not {\tt gnuzip} nor {\tt
compress} is acceptable. However they prefer the uncompressed form if
possible. From my experience I do not recommend this method.

\subsection{Things to note}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that there are the correct number of blank pages inserted
so that each double sided page has a front and a back.  So, for
example, the title page must be followed by an absolutely blank page
(not even a page number).

\item Submitted postscript introduces more potential problems.
Therefore you must either allow two iterations of the binding process
(once in a digital form, falling back to a second, paper, submission if
necessary) or submit both paper and electronic versions.

\item There may be unexpected problems with fonts.

\end{itemize}

I hope that this rough guide to writing a dissertation is \LaTeX\ has
been helpful and saved you time.
